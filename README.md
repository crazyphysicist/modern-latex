# Modern LaTeX template

These templates have the goal to typeset beautiful, modern documents in (Xe-)LaTeX.
For this it uses a fresh set of colors, elegant and field-proven fonts.

## Features

[x] Elegant fonts: Source Sans Pro and Source Serif Pro
[x] Simple structure
[ ] Additional packages for thesis layouts.

## Usage

To use the templates, you simply clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/crazyphysicist/modern-latex.git
$ cd modern-latex
```
If you want to update to the most current version, you simply pull the changes
from the master branch with
```
$ git pull origin master
```
For this to work, it is strongly recommended to NEVER change the following two files:
`main.tex` and `modernbook.cls`.
